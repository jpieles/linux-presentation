# GNU LINUX

## INTRODUCTION
Good Morning all...
Today i gonna tell you a little about GNU/Linux or just Linux
and why it's the best.
**page break**
For the content i will begin with history, which will be the biggest topic
of this presentation.
followed by the technical side of the linux operating system.
Than i will go over to how Linux is developed and explain the resulting
distributions. As a conclusion I will specify some pro's and cons
and finally I want to show you a little bit of the operating system.

## HISTORY
The history of Linux begins in the 1960's **page break**
with these two guys, Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie **page break**
When they developed the UNICKS Operating System **page break**
which was running on this machine here.



It was a really great operating system but for some it was a problem,
that it was propriatary. One of them was Richard Stallman, who worked at
the Artificial Inteligence Department at MIT.
He wanted to develop an Operating System, which is like UNIX but consists
of only **free software** called GNU (GNU is not UNIX)
[he later founded the *free software foundation** (FSF)

1983 Richard Stallman founded the GNU-Project.
He had the goal to create a UNIX-like operating system.
There has been written a great amount of software, but the operating system kernel
GNU Hurd was still in early development, and the development was also slow.

He came really far with translating GNU software in his free software world.
But the thing missing was the Operating System Kernel which would bind
everthing together.

In 1991 A young student called Linus Torvalds send an email into a minix
usergroup: **show email**
He build a UNIX like Operating System from Scratch (just for fun) and to
help other stundents with the same goal up and that they dont have to
start with nothing like him

## PHILOSOPHY

**FREE SOFTWARE**
Free Software can be defined by the four freedoms:
* *Freedom 0* Freedom to run the program for any purpose
* *Freedom 1* Freedom to study and change the program; access to the underlying source code
* *Freedom 2* Freedom to share copies to help your neighbor
* *Freedom 3* Freedom to distribute copies of modiefied versions to others

***
## ARCHITECTURE

Before I start with the technical side I have to explain what an Operating System even is.
An operating system is a system software that manages computer hardware, software resources
and provides commons services for Application. So the operating system is a software between the computer
hardware the the user Applications.

Kernel
The Kernel is the core of an operating system and provides the drivers in order to run the system.
i.E. for disks, the filesystem, graphics card, network adapter, keyboard, mouse

***
## SOFTWARE

Gnu Software

The commandline/shell
The commandline i.E. bash zsh or fish plays the most prominent role in the GNU world.
You don't HAVE to use it because there are knowadays GUI's for everything but it is
still the most powerful tool to get what you want fast
The commandline works almost exactly than the UNIX one

Package Manager
A package manager is like an oldschool App Store with which the user can download any kind
of software from public repositories and also synchronice them (update)
There are several kinds of them, the most common are APT and pacman
X Server

***
## DEVELOPMENT

Kernel Development
unlike other operating systems, Linux is built collaboratively across
companies, geographies and markets resolving into the largest collaborative development
project in the history of computing.
tousands of developers have contributed to the linux kernel
This contributions have resolved in about 28 million lines of code 
but its not just about the number of lines of code.
Its also how quickly linux is developed and released.
i.E. a major kernel comes out every 2-3 months.

Unique collaborative development process,
when submitting code to the linux kernel
developers break changes into individual units called patches
a patch describes the lines that need to be changed, added or removed from the source code.
Each patch can add a new feature, new support for a device, fix a problem, improve performance
or rework things to be mor easily understood.
Developers post their patches to the revelant mailing lists where other developers can reply with
feedback, when the path is close to being release ready.
It is accepted by a senior linux kernel developer or maintainer who manages one or more of
100 different sections of the kernel (this is not a guarantee that it will go to the main line.
Here it gets an even more extensive evaluation when the maintainer finished the review he will
sign off the patch and send it on to linux torvalds who has the ultimate authority on what is
accepted into the next release and what is not, nearly 10.000 patches go into almost every new release
about 6 patches are applied to the kernel each hour.

## DISTRIBUTIONS


A Linux distribution is a set of tuned software around the linux kernel (which is tuned in most times too)
What all Linux distributions have in Common is, that they all work on a or the linux kernel and use GNU Software.
Nearly every distributions is built around a package management system. That means that all parts of the distribution
can be installed, deinstalled und updated via the package manager.
Distributions are made by companies or by groups of international volunteers.


It doesnt really matter what Distro to use.
Because the choice of the right Linux Distrubtion is quite frustrating for beginners.
The only noticable differences are the preinstalled software packages.
The used Desktop Environment or Window Manager and the Package Manager

Distros:
* Debian
	* stable
* Arch
	* fast, lightweight
* Redhat
	* commercial
* Fedora
	* from Redhat, but not commercial
* Suse
	* idk
* Slackware
	* idk
* Kali
	* cyber security
	* penetration testing
* Mint
	* ubuntu, but better
* Ubuntu
	* debian in easier
	* most used distro
	* beginners friendly
* Manjaro
	* arch in easier
* Artix
	* arch, without systemd
* Parabola
	* arch, without proriatary software
	* completely free

***
## PROS AND CONS
### PROS
free (like free in free beer as well as out of charge)
no licensing issues or costs
no viruses
full suite of software applications
low resource use on hardware side
ported to a large number of hardware
easy to use
available in every language and every country
flexibilaty: can be run on everthing from watches to supercomputers
fast
most things work out of the box (drivers)
package manager
security


### CONS
if something does not work its hard to find out
