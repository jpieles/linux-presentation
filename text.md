# GNU/Linux

## Introduction
Good Morning all...
Today i gonna tell you a little about GNU/Linux or just Linux
and why it's the best.
**page break**
For the content i will begin with history, which will be the greatest topic
followed by the technical side of the linux operating system.
Than i will go over to how Linux is developed and explain the resulting
distributions. As a conclusion I will specify same pro's and cons
and finally I want to show you a little bit of the operating system.

## History
The history of Linux begins in the 1960's **page break**
with these two guys, Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie **page break**
When they developed the UNICKS Operating System **page break**
which was running on this machine here

...

It was a really great operating system but for some it was a problem,
that it was propriatary. One of them was Richard Stallman, who worked at
the Artificial Inteligence Department at MIT.
He wanted to develop an Operating System, which is like UNIX but consists
of only **free software** called GNU (GNU is not UNIX)
[he later founded the *free software foundation** (FSF)

He came really far with translating GNU software in his free software world.
But the thing missing was the Operating System Kernel which would bind
everthing together.

In 1991 A young student called Linus Torvalds send an email into a minix
usergroup: **show email**
He build a UNIX like Operating System from Scratch (just for fun) and to
help other stundents with the same goal up and that they dont have to
start with nothing like him

## Architecture

Before I start with the technical side I have to explain what an Operating System even is.
An operating system is a system software that manages computer hardware, software resources
and provides commons services for Application. So the operating system is a software between the computer
hardware the the user Applications

Kernel, Gnu Software

The commandline/shell
The commandline i.E. bash zsh or fish plays the most prominent role in the GNU world.
You don't HAVE to use it because there are knowadays GUI's for everything but it is
still the most powerful tool to get what you want fast
The commandline works almost exactly than the UNIX one

Package Manager
A package manager is like an oldschool App Store with which the user can download any kind
of software from public repositories and also synchronice them (update)
There are several kinds of them, the most common are APT and pacman
X Server

## Development

## Distributions

A Linux distribution is a set of tuned software around the linux kernel (which is tuned in most times too)
What all Linux distributions have in Common is, that they all work on a or the linux kernel and use GNU Software


It doesnt really matter what Distro to use.
Because the choice of the right Linux Distrubtion is quite frustrating for beginners.
The only noticable differences are the preinstalled software packages.
The used Desktop Environment or Window Manager and the Package Manager

## Pros and Cons
### Pros
free (like free in free beer as well as out of charge)
fast
most things work out of the box (drivers)
package manager
security

### Cons
if something does not work its hard to find out
